# tic-tac-toe
### Description
A fun project where I recreate tic tac toe using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project idea was originally from The Odin Project which you can view (here)[https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe]
#### Preview
You can preview the live project (here)[https://high23.github.io/tic-tac-toe/]

### Goals
The goals of this project were to have as little global code as possible.
To accomplish this I stored all my code in factory functions and modules.
